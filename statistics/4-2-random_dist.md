[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Question: The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every calue in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

>> First I will plot the PMF.  
  
```python
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
import random

rand = [random.random() for i in range(1000)]
pmf_rand = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand, label='random')
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_rand)
thinkplot.Show()
```

>> That looks random to me!
  
>> Now I will plot the CDF.
  
```python
cdf_rand = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf_rand)
thinkplot.Show()
```
  
![Cdf]
